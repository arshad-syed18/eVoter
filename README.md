# eVoter - Elections ReImagined
A website where users can vote in elections added by the election authority. Uses React + Node.js + Express + MySQL.

The eVoter project is an online platform for voting and managing elections. It aims to increase accessibility and convenience for voters by allowing them to cast their votes online, rather than having to physically go to a polling station.
Estonia is widely regarded as a pioneer in the use of online voting systems, having implemented electronic voting in 2005 and expanded its use in subsequent elections. Despite the success of Estonia's online voting system, relatively few other countries have attempted to implement similar systems

Admin can check and approve voters based on the information they provided. This information includes voterID, Aadhar, etc. Admin can create election polls,
add candidate information and view vote progress and results.
Voters once registered can view details of past, upcoming and current elections. They can view information on candidates for the current election.

The eVoter project is focused on the design and development of an online platform for voting and managing elections. The platform will provide a range of features and capabilities, including user registration using voter IDs and login, voting in active elections, and viewing previous and upcoming elections, the results of completed elections and candidate information.
In addition to these core functions, the eVoter project will also prioritize the security and integrity of the voting process, as well as the confidentiality of individual votes. These issues are critical to the success and credibility of any online voting system, and will be carefully considered in the design and implementation of the eVoter platform.
